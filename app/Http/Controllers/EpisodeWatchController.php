/**
 * Per-user episode watched state (spec §10 item 6): toggle a single episode,
 * bulk-toggle a whole season, and read a show's episodes back with this user's
 * watched flags.
 *
 * Design correction from item 5: toggling an episode does NOT require the show
 * to already be tracked. If there's no UserShowTracking row yet, one is
 * auto-created at status "watching" (jumping straight into an episode implies
 * active engagement, not "watch_later") before the toggle proceeds — as if the
 * user had tracked the show and immediately marked the episode.
 *
 * Everything is scoped to the authenticated user: watch rows resolve through
 * $request->user()->episodeWatches(), so one household member can never read or
 * flip another's data. The {episode}/{show} route bindings resolve *shared*
 * metadata (which is household-wide); the per-user row is always keyed by the
 * current user, so there's no foreign watch-row id to guess.
 *
 * Responses are JSON for now so these routes can be driven directly (curl /
 * tinker / tests) before any frontend exists; they become Inertia responses
 * when the Episodes tab lands (spec build-order item 11).
